This README contains the summerised details of Phase 3 project
# **<u>Project Title**
## **Dialing into Retention -**  ***Predicting Customer Churn at SyriaTel Using Machine Learning***

# Project Objective
This project aims to support SyriaTel, a leading telecommunications provider, in proactively reducing customer churn through predictive modeling. Churn remains a critical concern for the company, as each lost customer directly impacts recurring revenue and increases acquisition costs. By identifying which customers are at high risk of leaving, SyriaTel can target interventions more effectively, strengthen customer loyalty, and optimize resource allocation.

# **1. Understanding the Business Context**
### **<u>1.1. Brief Description of the Business**
SyriaTel currently lacks an efficient, data-driven method to anticipate customer churn. The existing approach is largely reactive, identifying churn only after it occurs—when it’s too late to intervene. 
The key business question this project seeks to answer is:
Can customer behavior and service usage patterns be used to accurately predict churn, enabling proactive engagement to retain at-risk customers?
Solving this problem will allow SyriaTel to shift from a reactive retention strategy to a proactive one, using predictive analytics to improve customer satisfaction, reduce revenue loss, and enhance operational efficiency.

### **<u>1.2. Stakeholders and Business Value**<u>
The primary stakeholders for this initiative are the **Customer Retention** and **Marketing teams**, who are directly responsible for minimizing churn and maximizing customer lifetime value. Secondary stakeholders include the **Call Center Operations team**, which handles customer grievances and service experiences, **Product Managers** designing service packages, and **Executive Leadership,** who require strategic insights to drive business performance. Each of these teams will benefit from the model’s ability to guide data-driven decisions and improve customer engagement strategies.

### **<u>1.3. The Business Question**
### 1.3.1 Key Business Question
The main business question that this project aim to address is:

- Can SyriaTel identify patterns in customer behavior and service usage that reliably predict churn, enabling proactive retention strategies?

### 1.3.2 The Specific Business Questions
1.	Which customers are most likely to churn?
2.	What are the main drivers of customer churn?
3.	How accurate is our churn prediction model?
4.	How can SyriaTel use these predictions to retain customers?
5.	What trade-offs exist between model complexity and interpretability?


### **<u>1.4 A Brief Description of the Chosen Dataset**
This project addresses customer churn prediction using the representative public Telco Customer Churn dataset (bigml_59c28831336c6604c800002a.csv;- applied as bigml_59) This dataset contains 3,333 customer records, each with 21 features covering demographics, account tenure, service usage, billing, and customer interactions. The target variable is binary churn status. Despite not being SyriaTel-specific, the dataset's structure mirrors typical telecom data, making it a relevant foundation for developing predictive models.

By analyzing this dataset with classification algorithms, the project aims to identify early indicators of customer churn. This process provides a potential blueprint for a predictive system that SyriaTel could adapt for its internal data. The dataset's realistic structure allows for the development of a practical solution for proactively managing customer attrition within a telecom context.
